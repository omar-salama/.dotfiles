## Installation Steps  

1. Install [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com).  
2. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if not already installed.  
   - **Note**: I'm using macOS. If you're on a different OS, install packages using the appropriate package manager:  
     - **Linux**: Use `apt`, `dnf`, or `pacman` depending on your distribution.  
     - **Windows**: Use [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) or [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).  

3. Install the tools using the following command:  
   ```bash  
   brew install starship zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting fzf zoxide eza thefuck tlrc bat  
   ```  

4. Install a Nerd Font (recommended: MesloLGS NF):  
   - Download from [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).  
   - Set it as the font in iTerm2 preferences:  
     - Go to **iTerm2 > Preferences > Profiles > Text > Change Font** and select your chosen Nerd Font.  

5. Configure Starship as your default prompt:  
   - Add this line to your shell configuration file (`~/.zshrc`):  
     ```bash  
     eval "$(starship init zsh)"  
     ```  

6. Enable `zsh-autosuggestions` and `zsh-syntax-highlighting`:  
   - Add the following lines to your `~/.zshrc` file:  
     ```bash  
     source /usr/local/share/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh  
     source /usr/local/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh  
     ```  

7. Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc` to apply changes.  

## Additional Configuration  

- Use `fzf` to enhance command history searching and file navigation.  
- Replace `ls` with `eza` by adding an alias:  
  ```bash  
  alias ls='eza'  
  ```  
- Add `thef*ck` alias:  
  ```bash  
  eval $(thef*ck --alias)  
  ```  
- Enable `tldr` for simplified command explanations.  
- Replace `cat` with `bat` using an alias:  
  ```bash  
  alias cat='bat'  
  ```  

For a fully configured setup, refer to my configuration files.

Enjoy your elevated terminal experience! ðŸš€
